<p> <font size=4 color="white"> Professor Dolores Umbridge, the new defense against the dark arts teacher has implemented new rules 
for hogwarts students. New rules include, staying 3 feet apart from your opposite gender, no kissing in the hallways, 
and of course, no sleeping in another house dorm. </p>

<p> <font size=4 color="white">  Professor McGonagall also added a new website (this one!) to check students' presence and their login 
attempts to their dorm. The Triwizard Tournament was a success even with life threatening situations that happened, 
we are free from any charges from the ministry. RIP Deadri- Cedric Diggory. We miss you. Also, is no one going to 
question how Harry Potter is still alive? No? Okay. </font> </p>
